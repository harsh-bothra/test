### SecurityExplained S-24: Vulnerable Code Snippet - 12

#### Vulnerable Code:

![Vulnerable Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harsh-bothra/SecurityExplained/main/media/code-12.jpg)

#### Solution:

The code is vulnerable to prototype pollution that could even lead to remote code execution. The statement in line 12 uses a dangerous pattern that allows for Prototype Pollution. When type is set to **proto**, then id and content can specify a key and value that will be set on Object.prototype.
