### SecurityExplained S-48: Vulnerable Code Snippet - 35

#### Vulnerable Code: 

![Vulnerable Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harsh-bothra/SecurityExplained/main/media/code-35.jpg)


#### Solution: 

The code is vulnerable to XSS and LFI. The focus of this code is that the filename can be used as a payload to execute JavaScript and perform an XSS attack. 
When filtering a function always remember that it's more than one bug that can be exploited in it. For example this is highly vulnerable to LFI but it's also vulnerable to XSS.
